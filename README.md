# max_clique
We are trying to find the max-clique size in appropriately defined graphs (gcd graphs in this case) containing N vertices, where N is of the form p<sub>1</sub><sup>M<sub>1</sub></sup>p<sub>2</sub><sup>M<sub>2</sub></sup>. Here p<sub>1</sub> and 
p<sub>2</sub> are prime numbers. Also, without loss of generality we can consider p<sub>1</sub> < p<sub>2</sub>

# Construction of graph from given N and divisor set D
D is a list of divisors. Any element of D is of the form p<sub>1</sub><sup>a</sup>p<sub>2</sub><sup>b</sup> where a $\leqslant$
